# testing

When you release a new version of the image, please test on linux and mac.

You should be able to:
- start the image with `docker run`
- visit localhost:8081 and see cans on the conveyor belt
- click the 'Configure' button in the web view and 
- viam-server should start successfully in the web view, and you should also see 'Live' go green on app.viam.com.
